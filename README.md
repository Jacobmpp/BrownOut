# Brown Out

A very simple adaptation of the Tiger Electronics game Lights Out
The goal is to make the board look like the goal

You can undo with 'z' Costs 1 point
You can change the size of the board with '-' and '+'

You gain more points for fewer clicks and larger boards

If you would like to ascribe lore to this game,
You are in a power management facitility controlling power to a city grid to reduce strain on the system.
You are on a backup system with an unituative control scheme trying to get to the state perscribed by your boss (The little one)
